# Viper-XCTemplates
### XCTemplates for Viper written on Swift. Plus some useful extensions. Usable for iOS 11+.

## Installing
1) Create a folder in `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File Templates` (you may have to create `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/` folder first), e.g. if you want to name folder `Viper`, type in Terminal `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File\ Templates/Viper`. In this case, `Viper` name will be used for template section in XCode.
You can use terminal command, such as `mkdir -p ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File\ Templates/Viper`
2) Just copy `*.xctemplate` folders in created folder. To open this folder, you can use a terminal command `open ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File\ Templates/Viper`
